For example, cement production, chemical manufacturing, and waste management all contribute to the problem.\\n\\n4. **Agriculture**: Agricultural practices, particularly livestock farming, emit methane (a potent greenhouse gas). Additionally, the use of fertilizers can lead to nitrous oxide emissions.\\n\\n5. **Land Use Changes**: Urbanization and changes in land use can affect the Earth's surface and alter carbon storage and absorption capabilities, which can contribute to climate change.\\n\\n6. **Waste Management**: Landfills produce methane as organic waste decomposes anaerobically, contributing further to greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nWhile natural changes in the climate do occur, such as volcanic eruptions or variations in solar radiation, the current trends in climate change are largely attributed to human activity, especially since the Industrial Revolution. The consensus among scientists is clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions and taking action on climate change is crucial for the future of our planet.\\nHuman: summarize it\\nAI: The primary causes of climate change are mainly due to human activities, which include:\\n\\n1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat.\\n2. **Deforestation**: Cutting down trees reduces carbon absorption and releases stored CO2.\\n3. **Industrial Processes**: Industries contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.\\n4. **Agriculture**: Farming, particularly livestock, emits methane, and fertilizer use can release nitrous oxide.\\n5. **Land Use Changes**: Urbanization alters carbon storage and absorption.\\n6. **Waste Management**: Landfills produce methane as waste decomposes.\\n\\nWhile natural factors exist, the current trends in climate change are largely driven by these human-induced activities, especially since the Industrial Revolution. Reducing emissions is crucial for the planet's future.\\nHuman: summarise previous conversation\\nAI: In our previous conversation, we discussed the primary causes of climate change, which are mainly driven by human activities. The key points include:\\n\\n1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Fossil fuel burning releases gases that trap heat.\\n2. **Deforestation**: Cutting down trees reduces carbon absorption and releases CO2.\\n3. **Industrial Processes**: Industries contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.\\n4. **Agriculture**: Farming, especially livestock, produces methane, and fertilizers can release nitrous oxide.\\n5. **Land Use Changes**: Urbanization affects carbon storage and absorption.\\n6. **Waste Management**: Landfills generate methane as waste decomposes.\\n\\nOverall, while natural factors play a role, current climate change trends are largely attributed to these human activities, and reducing emissions is vital for the future of the planet.\\nHuman: explain abount environment\\nAI: The environment refers to the natural and artificial surroundings in which an organism or an ecosystem functions. It encompasses everything around us, including air, water, soil, and living things, as well as their interactions. Protecting the environment and reducing the negative impacts of human activities on it are essential for maintaining the health and wellbeing of both humans and the planet as a whole. Failure to do so can result in adverse environmental, social, and economic consequences, such as pollution,\""

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
